Lmod has detected the following error: The following module(s) are unknown:
"opencv-python/4.5.5.64" "numpy/1.22.3" "pandas/1.4.1" "keras/2.8.0"

Please check the spelling or version number. Also try "module spider ..."
It is also possible your cache file is out-of-date; it may help to try:
  $ module --ignore-cache load "opencv-python/4.5.5.64" "numpy/1.22.3"
"pandas/1.4.1" "keras/2.8.0"

Also make sure that all modulefiles written in TCL start with the string
#%Module
